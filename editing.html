  <h1>EDITING</h1>  
  <hr>
  <input>
<p> Editing is the process of selecting and preparing written,<span style="color: aqua;">visual</span>, audible, or cinematic material used by a person or an entity to convey a message or information. The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organization, and many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete piece of work<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p> <b>The Editing Process</b> often begins with the author's idea for the work itself, continuing as a collaboration between the author and the editor as the work is created. Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods<sup>[2/3]</sup></p>
<p>There are various editorial positions in publishing. Typically, one finds editorial assistants <u>reporting to the senior-level editorial staff</u> and directors who report to senior executive editors. Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release. The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap.</p>
<p>The top editor at many publications may be known as the<strike>cheif editor</strike> executive editor, or simply the editor. A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a magazine may acquire the title of editor-at-large or contributing editor. Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features. In U.S. newspapers, the level below the top editor is usually the managing editor.</p>
<p>At <mark>newspapers and wire services</mark>, press or copy editors write headlines and work on more substantive issues, such as ensuring accuracy, fairness, and taste. In some positions, they design pages and select news stories for inclusion. At British and Australian newspapers, the term is sub-editor. They may choose the layout of the publication and communicate with the printer. These editors may have the title of layout or design editor or (more so in the past) makeup editor.</p>

<p>Editing firms may employ a team of in-house editors, rely on a network of individual contractors or both<sup>[18]</sup> Such firms are able to handle editing in a wide range of topics and genres, depending on the skills of individual editors. The services provided by these editors may be varied and can include proofreading, copy editing, online editing, developmental editing, editing for search engine optimization, etc.</p>
